📖 Introduction

With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence tools such as ChatGPT and other text generators, it has become increasingly difficult to distinguish between human-written content and AI-generated content.

This project aims to solve this problem by developing a Machine Learning powered web application that can analyze text patterns and predict whether the content is written by a human or generated by AI.

The application provides a clean user interface where users can paste or type text and instantly receive a prediction.

❗ Problem Statement

AI-generated content is widely used in:

Education (assignments, essays)

Journalism

Online platforms

Social media

This raises concerns such as:

Academic dishonesty

Fake content spread

Loss of authenticity

There is a strong need for tools that can automatically detect AI-generated text.

💡 Solution Overview

This project uses:

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Machine Learning classification

Flask web framework

to create a real-time AI detection system.

The model is trained using real datasets and deployed through a web interface for easy use.

✨ Features

✔ Real-time AI vs Human text detection
✔ Clean modern web interface
✔ Auto expanding text input box
✔ Machine learning based predictions
✔ Uses real datasets
✔ Lightweight and fast

🛠 Technologies Used
Programming Language

Python

Machine Learning Libraries

Pandas

Scikit-learn

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains:

Text samples

Labels indicating human or AI-generated content

Example structure:

Text	Label
This is a human written essay	0
This content is generated by AI	1

Where:

0 → Human Written

1 → AI Generated

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and cleaned before training.

🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
Step 1: Load Dataset

The dataset is loaded using Pandas.

Step 2: Text Preprocessing

The text is cleaned by:

Converting to lowercase

Removing links

Removing special characters

Removing extra spaces

This improves model accuracy.

Step 3: Feature Extraction

The project uses CountVectorizer (Bag of Words model) to convert text into numerical vectors.

This allows the machine learning model to understand word frequency patterns.

Step 4: Model Training

The algorithm used is:

👉 Multinomial Naive Bayes

Why Naive Bayes?

Fast

Highly effective for text classification

Widely used in NLP

Step 5: Saving Model

The trained model and vectorizer are saved as:

model.pkl

vectorizer.pkl

These files are loaded by the web application for predictions.

🌐 Web Application Workflow

User enters text in the UI

Flask backend receives input

Text is vectorized

ML model predicts

Result is displayed instantly
