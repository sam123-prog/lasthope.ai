AI vs Human Text Detector
A web-based tool that analyzes written text and predicts whether it was generated by an AI model or written by a human.

What This Project Does ?
-Takes user-input text
-Analyzes linguistic and statistical patterns
-Predicts AI-generated or Human-written content
-Displays the result instantly
-No gimmicks. Just classification.

Why This Exists ?
AI-generated content is everywhere—assignments, blogs, posts, spam.
This project explores how language patterns differ between human writing and AI output.
Features.
-Simple and clean UI
-Real-time text analysis
-Fast predictions
-Easy to extend or improve
-Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend / Logic: (add your language or framework here)
Model / Logic: Rule-based or ML-based text analysis (be honest here)

How to Use ?
Enter or paste text into the input box
Click Analyze
View the prediction result
That’s it. If it needs a manual, your UI failed.
Limitations (Important)
Predictions are not 100% accurate
Short texts reduce reliability
Advanced AI models may bypass detection
Anyone claiming perfect accuracy is lying.
Future Improvements
Improve detection accuracy
Add confidence score

Support multiple languages
API support
